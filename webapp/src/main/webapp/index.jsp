<h2> Learn QA Automation tools + Devops Tools CI/CD pipelines in course from Scratch to end All</h2>
<h2> Good Luck and we are almost done with the course for 2025 Devops Course.Thankyou
The project I will be handling is deploying a web app in Tomcat server
Copying Build Artifacts from the project to Azure
Apply Continues integration to the build pipeline for every commit
Setting up release pipeline with linux resource to deploy the artifact
War file or Rtfax is the file that is placed on a server to run the code
A devops guy usually asks the Build file to the developers
CI/CD - Continues Integration is the process of automating a war file if any of the developers make any changes to it. , for example here - on the hello world project a change was made and the code was committed to the git hub repo and it will now run the "mvn test install" automatically and create the war file. 
"Continues Integration is like if any changes commit to the code then it should create the build file"
Whenever we commit any code changes to the project it automatically build pipeline gets triggered and it will build our project create war file and it places automatically to pipeline project home path</h2>
